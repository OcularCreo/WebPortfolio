## The Overview 
To refine my design skills, I participated in a competition to create a logo for a student-run organization. The challenge was to design a logo that embodies the organization's spirit within a few days. The following characteristics were sought:
- Social
- Fun
- Modern
- Safe
- Supportive
- Credible

Additionally, the designs needed to:
-  Fit in both circular and square frames
-  Utilize the brand colour of Salmon (#F58F58) along with any additional bright colours

With no limit to the number of submissions, I created several concepts in just about a day. I began by researching examples of clean and modern logos online. Once I had enough inspiration, I moved on to creating a variety of colour palettes using the provided Salmon colour as a base. From there, I applied these palettes to my designs, resulting in a range of modern and colourful logos.

Some of my designs were presented in rectangular frames or had wider layouts to showcase the brand with its full name. However, I also ensured that each design included isolated logos intended for use in square and circular frames. This approach ensured versatility and adaptability for various applications, meeting the competition's requirements while effectively showcasing my graphic design abilities.
