## The Overview
At the start of my graphic design career, my media arts teacher recognized my natural talent for vector art and design composition, leading to him encouraging me to participate in the Ontario Skills Competition. I took on the challenge of creating a poster to advertise the event, aiming to attract more attendees with eye catching special guests and impactful slogans/themes.

Inspired by the significance of the Ontario Skills Competition, I crafted a design that prominently featured the event's logo. My concept included an illustration of a hand with the logo emerging from it, with icons flowing out of each ribbon representing the creativity and talent showcased at the event. I cleverly utilized the red ribbon of the event's logo to swirl across the design, forming the '0' in the text commemorating the event's 30th anniversary. Additionally, I related the poster's slogan, "The change is in your hands," to the main focal point.

To create this design, I photographed a hand using my Canon T6i, then imported the image into Adobe Illustrator to convert it into a vector. Utilizing masks, layers, effects, the pen tool, and various other Illustrator tools, I brought my vision to life. I then attended the Ontario Skills Competition to present the final poster to the judges, explaining my design choices and the rationale behind them.

Ultimately, my work earned me a 7th place finish out of 22 participants, marking a significant milestone in my journey as a graphic designer.
