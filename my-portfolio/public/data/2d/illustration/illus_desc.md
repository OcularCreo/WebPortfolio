## Software & Tools
- Adobe Illustrator 
- Pencil & Paper

## The Overview 
This project highlights my standard process for designing graphics in Adobe Illustrator. I typically begin by sketching my ideas on paper, refining them until I have a clear outline of the design. Depending on the project, I may look into other artwork to gather inspiration and ideas, sometimes even leading to the creation of a moodboard. I then scan the sketch and import it into Illustrator.

Using the pen tool, basic shapes, and other necessary Illustrator tools, I start creating a clean and precise vectorized version of my sketch. Depending on the project, I may trace over the sketch as a starting point, then refine the shapes to achieve a more precise outcome.

Once the basic design is in place, I carefully select a colour palette that complements the concept. This often involves drawing inspiration from the design references I found or current trends. I often experiment with multiple colour palettes to search for and create a visually appealing and cohesive final product.

Each project is an opportunity to learn new tools, refine my skills, and incorporate fresh ideas, ensuring continuous improvement in my design capabilities. Each project provided me the opportunity to expand my current design skills while also delivering high-quality, professional graphics that meet the needs and expectations of clients.
