## The Overview
Using provided 2D sketches, I brought a character to life in 3D. I started by sculpting the character's head in Blender, then exported the head to Maya for retopology using the Quad Draw tool. Afterward, I modeled the rest of the character in Maya and created UV maps for texturing. This project demonstrates my proficiency in transitioning from 2D concepts to detailed 3D models, utilizing industry-standard software to achieve professional results.

## Reflection
While revisiting this project, I recognize areas for improvement, particularly in texturing and certain aspects of the model. These insights have driven my growth as a 3D artist, enhancing my skills in both modeling and texturing.
