## The Overview
In this project, I created a realistic 3D environment by re-creating the Flood Cylix Room from Halo Infinite. Utilizing advanced texture mapping techniques—including light, bump, normal, and displacement maps—I aimed to achieve high-quality visual output suitable for game engine integration. The final deliverables include shaded and wireframe renders, showcasing detailed texturing and atmospheric lighting. Due to time constraints, the renders exhibit a significant amount of grain and fireflies. Despite these challenges, this project highlights my expertise in texture mapping and environment modeling, and the experience has provided valuable insights for further refining my approach to achieve even more polished and professional results.
