## The Overview 
As part of my animation training, I took on the challenge of animating a flour bag. I started by finding a reference animation of a flour bag and used it to sketch out key and in-between frames in Photoshop, making detailed notes and drawing lines to indicate the timing between each pose. Next, I blocked out the poses on a flour bag rig in Maya, eventually smoothing out the animation to create the final video presented here.

Throughout the animation process, I diligently applied the principles of animation, incorporating elements such as arcs, exaggeration, squash, and stretch to bring the flour bag to life. This project demonstrates my ability to follow traditional animation steps and effectively use industry-standard tools to create fluid, dynamic animations.
