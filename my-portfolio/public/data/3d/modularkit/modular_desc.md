## Context & Details
The work completed for this assignment is a modular kit for creating exterior saloon 
structures within a desert/western environment. The kit follows a scaling of 3M and 1.5M 
with some exceptions. It includes wood plank tiled standard walls, saloon ending walls, 
windows, standard door size, and wide door size. Similar to typical saloon design, porch and 
balcony floors are included and accompanied by support beams of different varients. Modular
railings and railing posts were also created for them to be used on any surface but most
notabiliy the porches or balconies.To lead up to the balconies or other levels of the saloon, 
stairs have been modularized along with their own set of support beams and variants, while 
porches have a small set of steps to make it easier to walk onto. 3 different modularized 
roofs of angles 45, 26, and 18 degrees have been modularized along with left, right, and end 
pieces to accommodate sections of the wall which would require triangular pieces to keep it 
completed. Simple flat plans are also made for the roofs too. To add more detail to the saloon
I created some saloon swinging doors, barrels, benches, and lanterns. I wanted to go for a 
low poly but stylized western saloon theme while making this kit. 

The scene I created demonstrates how users of the kit I created can make different kinds of 
saloons. The building on the left is a bigger saloon including balconies on the front and 
back, a saloon end wall variant at the front-top-center, a stair way to the back balcony, 
and several doorways, windows, and props. This saloon would be an example of what one might 
see in a bigger sized western town. The saloon on the right includes many of the same pieces,
however it offers a demonstration of how to use all slanted roof variants, a thin beam 
support varient, and the alternative saloon end wall variant. This saloon may be something 
one would run into while in a small dinky western town. 

Please not that the doorways have been sealed with a plane to hide the inside of the saloon, 
as without them you would be able to see through the walls.
