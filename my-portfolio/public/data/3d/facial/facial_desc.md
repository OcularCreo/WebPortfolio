## The Overview
In my rigging and animation class, we were tasked with creating a facial animation based on a scene of our choice, incorporating various visemes. A starter scene featuring a facial rig of Aang from Avatar: The Last Airbender was provided to us, causing many versions of Aang saying and acting out a variety of scenes. The assignment deliverables required a blocked-out animation along with a library of expressions and visemes, which you can see above the videos.

To add a personal touch and make the project more enjoyable, I chose an over the top and silly scene from my favorite TV show, Community. In this scene a character screams out in terror, announcing the return of the college's relentless prankster. Using SyncSketch, I recorded the clip and applied sketches over key frames for reference to ultize during the animation process.

I completed the assignment ahead of schedule and took the opportunity to smooth out the blocked version, resulting in both a blocked and a smooth animation. This project not only demonstrates my technical skills in rigging and animation but also showcases my ability to bring characters to life with expressive, dynamic facial animations.
