## The Overview 
One of the assignments in my rigging and animation course required creating an animation based on a reference that included significant movement and agility. Inspired by a YouTube Shorts creatorâ€™s parkour videos, I chose one of his clips for reference. I imported the clip into SyncSketch to make detailed notes and draw the positioning of his body, focusing separately on the upper and lower body movements.

While animating in Maya, I utilized the sketches and references I created to animate the movements onto the provided rigged character. While animated with the rig, I noticed a control implying the ability to switch between FK and IK. Unfortunately I could not get the control to function leaving the rig stuck in FK. This limitation meant the character's arms were stuck in FK, making interactions with walls and surfaces more challenging. Despite this, I successfully conveyed the fluidity and agility of parkour movements in the animation.
