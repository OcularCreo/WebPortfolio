## The Overview 

For this assignment, I chose to create a walk cycle of someone who is extraordinarily exhausted. I picked this concept because I could relate to feeling extremely tired and letting my limbs move haphazardly. Additionally, I thought it would be entertaining to animate a character with such a careless posture and movement.

## Challenges

While working on this project, I found that identifying the right poses from the reference video was challenging for two main reasons. First, the video quality was poor, resulting in some blurry frames. Second, the lazy nature of the reference's walk made it difficult to identify each key pose. Matching the poses to my draw-overs was tricky due to different body proportions and my interpretation angle. For instance, the right arm in the draw-overs seemed to barely swing, but when modeled on the mannequin, it appeared stiff and unnatural. I adjusted it to swing more, deviating slightly from the reference. The most challenging aspect was building confidence. At the time, I found the assignment intimidating and often second-guessed myself, leading to anxiety with every move I made.

## Achievements 

Reflecting on this project, I'm proud of the left arm's animation on the mannequin, despite this being my first solo animation project. I'm also proud of pushing through the anxiety that typically causes me to procrastinate. I managed to complete the assignment to the best of my ability at the time. Initially worried that the mannequin didn't look tired, I sought feedback from six people, all of whom confirmed it appeared as intended. For a first-time solo animation, I think I did well and recognize there's still room for improvement. This project was a significant milestone in overcoming self-doubt and gaining confidence in my animation skills.
