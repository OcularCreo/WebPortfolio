## Environmental Story
Years ago, the tentions between nations gave rise to the climax of nuclear fall out. Most people dismissed your preparation
as paranoia, but it really saved your life. In contrast to the good old days, you spend your leasurely time at your desk, 
studying the pages of engineering, survival, and sometimes even fantasy books. When books weren't enough to escape your 
grim reality, you tend to your plants who you've grown a strong companionship towards as you regularly talk or strum 
melodies to, losely gripping any ounce of sanity you can maintain. Out scavanging during the evening, while the weather is 
more tame, you gravitate towards cars as they offer gas, scrap metal, and sometimes food or trinkets. The luxury of 
electricity is enjoyed via generators which are fed the scavanged gasoline. By now you've butcher too many cars to count, 
as piles of their remains build up around the entrance and are utlized in other areas of your bunker. Before leaving you
consistently track your travels on your map, hoping to find parking lots or car junk yards, and strategically plan which
areas you'll explore next. In an appocolypse, you realize that not every encounter you have will be friendly, which is 
why you carry a gun everytime you leave to explore. But, some days while holding onto hope, you hang around your couch with
the radio on, hoping to hear a friendly voice. A second bed has been set up for a while, as you hope to find a companion to
make survival more manageable.    

## Intensions
The environment I created is meant to invoke the feeling of a fortified and structurally sound bunker, with minimal regard
for comforting features like carpets, pillows, and other home-like items. The natural sunlight coming in
is meant to be strong to communicate or suggest to the viewer extreme weather, and effectively lead the eye towards the 
center point of the butchered car. Other elements like wires or a barrel and hose located farther from the car are meant to draw the 
eyes towards the focal point of the car as well. Some of the beauty shots do not include the focal point of the car, and 
instead present the other detailed areas of the bunker the character lives in.

I created two static blueprint meshes for the food and plant shelves of the bunker, both of which fall into the category
of complex and variable. The shelves are very repetative in the bunker setting, and having them be static blueprint meshes
allows me to move the resources on the shelves to create variants and further sell the idea of the environment.
