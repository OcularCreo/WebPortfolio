## Enviornmental Story
During the time of ancient Rome, a cruel emperor gained great satisfaction from action packed and intense gladiator 
trials. These brutal spectacles featured extravagant arenas, designed and constructed by the orders of the emperor. The 
complexities of the arenas encouraged gladiators to consider their environment during combat for either their own advantage
or vigilance, while also including elements to immitate real life environments in Rome. Fighters who survive the 
trails against other gladiators would be crowned the emperor's champion. This champion emerged from the emperor's grand 
chambers, and is provided with many advantages to dominate and execute all other fighters who entered the 
arena via small grim tunnels. This arena includes hazards such as a water mote with no means of escape and a spike pit,
accompanied by ruins and gardens designed to serve as both cover or obstacles. the remains of many fallen gladiators are 
scattered across the arena, inspiring more fear to those striving to be a champion of the emperor. 

## Intensions
The primary focal point of the environment is the central fighting arena. Supporting focal points include the traps or 
decorations within the arena along with the emperor's chambers located at the top of the towering structure inside. 
The mote within the environment will be filled with water, being the dynamic blueprint of the project. Many braziers 
and torches will be placed around the environment most of which should be lit with fire made with an fx system.

The environment is designed to feature realistic assets, with the intention of being set in a world very similar to ours. 
However, acceptions of realism will be made while considering the plausability of constructing a complex arena like the 
one being proposed in real life. The arena is inspired by ones featured in video games such as Assassin's Creed Origins
and Ryse Son of Rome.
