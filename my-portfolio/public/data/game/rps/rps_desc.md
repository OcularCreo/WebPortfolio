## The Overview
At the end of 2023, in collaboration with my teammates, to showcased my first ever local multiplayer game R.P.S.: Best of Three (Rock, Paper, Scissors). Using Unity, we developed a 2D platformer-fighting game utilizing a twist based on the mechanics of rock, paper, scissors. 

In my Advanced Game Development course, I formed a team to develop a video game within of 2-3 months. The project started with fun idea generation sessions where we pitched many wacky concepts. Naturally, as this course took place during the start of the development of my capstone game "Dam'ed", I purposed rejected ideas from my capstone project. Inspired by rejected ideas from my capstone game "Dam'ed," I proposed a game where two players in an arena play rock, paper, scissors, and the winner fights the loser with a weapon while the loser tries to avoid their opponent. Members of the team favoured this concept and quickly added the own alterations and quickly morphoed the game into what we know as RPS: Best of Three. 

My involvment in this project included the implimentating local multiplayer coop, player movement, and character swapping mechanics, while also creating the vector assets and collaborating on the backgrounds/environments. During development, I simultaneously sketched character concepts and created psuedo code, consistenlyt seeiking feedback to refine my work. These ideas would be brough to life in Illustrator and Unity. Developing this game gave me valuable experience in creating local multiplayer games in Unity, which greatly benefited my work on "Dam'ed."

Course mandatite Alpha and Beta playtests, along our own playtests, encourage multiple iterations of our game and saw the team working together to discuss what improvements and changes we should make. Presenting our game on demo day was a highlight, as we witnessed players discovering and creating strategies to gain an advantage over their opponents. The game quickly became a hit, with visitor demand increasing rapidly, prompting our team to set up additional demo stations. Our team's collaboration and commitment resulted in a fun and intense competitive game.
