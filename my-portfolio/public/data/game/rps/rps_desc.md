**Role:** Programmer & Graphic Artist

*RPS: Best of Three* is my first ever local multiplayer game. This game is a 2D platformer-fighting game, utilizing a competitive twist inspired by the classic mechanics of rock-paper-scissors. Development was done within Unity over a 2-3 month period as part of an Advanced Game Development course. Prior to development, each of the four team members conducted research on a specific topic: movement mechanics, risk and reward, or emotional engagement in games. Members of the team were free to develop any part of the game, but were additionally required to contribute within areas related to their research. 

Despite the challenges faced implementing each research topic and diving into local multiplayer for the first time, the team successfully developed a game that delivered on all fronts. Demo day, where students showcased their projects, provided further proof of our success as visitors crowded our area, prompting additional stations to be set up throughout the room.

*RPS: Best of Three* is available on Itch.io and supports all controllers (controls display for Xbox). Grab a friend and experience the fun!

## DEVELOPMENT PROCESS

---

After completing the course research assignments, students of different topics formed teams and began generating game ideas. During this phase, I proposed a rejected concept from my capstone project. My idea of an arena-like game utilizing rock, paper, scissors mechanics was quickly embraced by the team, who added their creative elements. 

Being an unfamiliar area to my teammates and professor, I independently researched and implemented a multiplayer system using online videos, forms, and Unity’s official documentation. Additionally, I created the first iterations of the round timer, character swapping, and win-lose states. Researching the topic of player movement, I made extra effort to include basic movement that felt good to the player. This inspired me to include coyote time and jump buffering alongside more basic elements such as momentum, air control, and double jumps. 

Collectively analyzing data from periodic playtests revealed the following issues:

- Player-swapping mechanics were too complex
- inadequate distinction between characters
- UI did not effectively communicate game states

The team worked together to address each issue through rigorous planning and strategizing. We simplified the player swapping mechanics to holding a single button hold accompanied by a transition animation. Each character gained more distinction through special combat moves, and changes in their movement. I worked with another team member to make each player feel different in speed and weight while adjusting damage output for balancing. 

Using my skills in Adobe Illustrator, I created character assets, titles, and UI, that effectively communicated the state of many game elements. I worked alongside another artist to create multiple backgrounds. Finally, to quickly teach players how to play our game I worked on creating a quick tutorial that could easily be accessed on the main menu.

## RESULTS & REFLECTIONS

Alpha and beta playtests were crucial while shaping the game into its final form. The game went through many iterations based on player feedback, improving the mechanics, balancing and overall gameplay experience. The team successfully incorporated elements of each member’s research topic including, movement mechanics, emotion, and risk and reward. This resulted in satisfying and distinctive character movement/abilities, intense gameplay, and the encouragement of strategic character selection.
During demo day, RPS: Best of Three became a crowd favorite, with high demand prompting us to set up additional demo stations. The experience taught me valuable lessons in rapid iteration, teamwork, and the dynamics of local multiplayer gameplay. With a solid foundation, I plan on continuing development for the game in the future.
