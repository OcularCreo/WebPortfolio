## The Overview
Over eight months, I collaborated with my team to develop "Dam'ed," a video game created from scratch. Our primary goals were high replayability, ease of learning, and ensuring the game could be experienced within the limited time of the capstone fair while making it exceptionally fun.

The team started with idea generation, leading to my proposal of a cooperative team game playing as beavers, searching for resources and maintain their dam against a flood. While this idea was well-received, a teammate's preference for disrupting team dynamics inspired me to alter my concept. Thus "Dam'ed" was born: a competitive local multiplayer game, positioning players on opposing teams of beavers with the objective to have the last dam standing. We pitched the final idea to a committee of professors and instructors acting as shareholders, who provided thorough feedback. Monthly presentations showcased our progress, changes, and reasoning.

As the lead and sole programmer on the team, I handled all coding tasks. I began by creating a state map to visualize the game's interactions and systems, providing clarity for those involved in the project. With a limited timeline due to a short development period and other course demands, I worked asynchronously from the art team. Primitive shapes were often used during the initial implementation of features to represent players, objects, and environments, with their functionality tested in a prototype scene.

My methods of coding focused on modularizing scripts to ensure efficiency and ease of adjustment. This made implementing finalized and new assets nearly seamless and allowed for easy modifications to game features like player speed and friction. Each new feature underwent thorough testing, where I actively sought out and resolved bugs to ensure smooth gameplay. Obscure bugs found during play sessions were quickly noted, and I collaborated with my two other teammates, who acted as QA, to identify the exact actions that caused the bugs.

During development, I frequently consulted Unity's documentation and forums to deepen my understanding of its systems and optimize my code. Utilizing resources like YouTube, Unity's documentation, and several coding forum sites helped me overcome stubborn bugs and implement challenging features.

Testing the game myself and gathering data from user playtests helped identify features that needed changes and new systems that could improve the game. These changes and additions were discussed with the team during weekly meetings to considering their potential impact on the game's interconnected systems. Thorough playtesting ensured that all elements worked together harmoniously. Changes were more frequent during the final stages of development as I worked closely with my team and playtesters to precisely balance the game.

Upon completion, we presented "Dam'ed" at our capstone fair. Placed in a special room dedicated to couch co-op, our area quickly became overcrowded with visitors eager to try and replay our game. We eventually presented our product to judges from the game industry, explaining our creation and major goals. We were praised for having a perfect scope, impeccable game stability, and achieving our overall goal of creating a fun game. In the end, we received a perfect score from the judges. Due to the time, dedication, and effort I provided, this project has been one of my most significant achievements to date and this short description only provides a glymps into the techniques, planning, and coordination done to reach our achievements.
