**Role:** Lead Programmer

For our capstone project, I worked with a team to develop a competitive local multiplayer game positioning players on opposing teams of beavers with the objective to have the last dam standing. From the beginning our goals were to create an easy to learn and highly replayable game, with a significant focus on delivering a fun experience that players could fully enjoy within the short time frame available to visitors at the capstone fair.

As the lead programmer, I managed all technical aspects of the project, from gameplay mechanics to system architecture. Throughout development, our team regularly presented milestone updates, demonstrating progress and justifying changes based on user testing feedback or challenges encountered. The final game was presented to industry judges, earning a perfect score and praise for delivering a well-balanced, engaging experience with a clear "fun factor."

## DEVELOPMENT PROCESS

---

During an idea generation session, I pitched the concept of creating a multiplayer beaver game focused on maintaining a dam. With modifications made by other teammates, the final concept for the game was settled upon. Over the following weeks, we collaborated to create detailed design documents and state maps to guide development.

As lead programmer, process followed these phases:

1. **Script Development:** I prioritized the most urgent mechanics, systems, and assets, writing modular scripts to allow simplistic readability, testing and debugging of code. Object oriented principles like classes and inheritance, also allowed me to refactored shared functionalities for efficiency.

2. **Bug Testing:** Initial scripts were tested in a prototype scene, allowing me to isolate issues and resolve bugs early in development.

3. **Integration:** Once tested, the code was integrated into the game scene. This phase acted as a secondary testing phase as I worked with my team to ensure harmony and functionality between the new and pre existing work.

4. **User Testing & Feedback:** Through playtesting, we gathered data on game performance and player experience, which helped us identify necessary adjustments. We analyzed the feedback as a team to improve mechanics and overall balance.

Throughout development, I used placeholder assets to maintain progress while anticipating the arrival of final assets. Additionally, I conducted independent research on Unity’s game engine to follow best practices and optimization techniques ensuring strong performance and stability. Overall, development would follow this iterative process considering conclusions met from weekly team meetings, user testing, and debugging cases. 

## RESULTS & REFLECTIONS

Working as a lead programmer on a large scale project allowed me to enhance my technical skills in game development while working closely with my team. I have gained valuable experience managing communication between the technical and art teams, while learning to delegate tasks and provide guidance playing to each member’s strengths. I improved my code through continuously focusing on best practices and optimization techniques to provide optimal performance. Player experiences maintained equal importance as I incorporated user feedback and tirelessly contributed efforts to balance the game. Like many games, UI, controls, systems and structures all went through many iterations all with the player in mind.

The team’s efforts earned us a perfect score from industry judges and our game became a highlight of the capstone fair. The room showcasing our final work quickly became crowded quickly being filled with laughter and excitement from visitors playing our game, making it a rewarding and memorable experience for the whole team.
