**Role:** Lead Programmer & Vector Artist

Pastry Peril is an intense cooking game developed during my second year game development course. Players take on the role of a chef competing in a cooking show, challenging contestants to quickly memorize the recipe ingredients and select the correct ones from a given set. With the ingredients missing from the instructions, contestants must follow the instructions to bake a dessert to the best of their abilities. The game’s core challenge lies in the stress-inducing timers, randomized ingredients, and difficulty scaling, creating an intense and engaging experience. This project allowed me to learn the essential basics of Unity such as creating prefabs, animating, reading inputs, and working with basic physics.

## KEY FEATURES

---

- Difficulty Levels: Included difficulty levels to allow players to challenge themselves as they progress, with significant decrease in time constraints.

- Cooking Mechanics: Developed interactive cooking systems where players follow recipe steps in sequence.

- Randomization for Replayability: Introduced random ingredient variations, such as different types of sugar (granulated, brown, cane), to enhance replay value.

- Scoring and Rating System: Built a scoring mechanic based on chosen ingredients, cook time, and correct ingredient usage  to encourage competitive gameplay.

## DEVELOPMENT PROCESS

---

The development process for Pastry Peril began with idea generation exercises, using prompts like “a game with an interesting mechanic like _____” to kickstart creativity. The team recorded every idea and continued to build off the strongest concepts, leading to Pastry Peril. We then created a pitch presentation to present to the class and guests from the industry. Feedback from the presentation helped shape our game even more, highlighting the importance of replayability and encouraging randomization.

Given that this was one of the team’s first Unity projects we aimed for a small scope. We followed an iterative development pattern, beginning with collaborative asset creation in Adobe Illustrator. Using my existing programming knowledge and techniques shown in the Intro to Game Development course, I developed scripts to implement the assets into Unity. I continuously tested each script, acquiring additional testing from my teammates to catch further issues.

The course structured development with alpha and beta build deadlines, providing additional opportunities for external user testing. While playtesting was done virtually due to the initial rise of covid, testers revealed weaknesses in the UI and overlooked bugs. Playtest results encouraged me to revisit and refine these elements, improving the gameplay and clarity. This iterative process ensured that Pastry Peril continued to evolve, resulting in a highly polished and engaging experience in the final build.

## RESULTS & REFLECTIONS

During the virtual demo day, the team was happy to hear praise on the final build’s intense and engaging gameplay. Incorporating dramatic classical music, daunting timers, and quick memorization tasks evoked the desired emotional response from our players. This project marked the near beginning of my game development journey, significantly strengthening my development and teamwork skills, while allowing me to learn about dynamic game mechanics.
