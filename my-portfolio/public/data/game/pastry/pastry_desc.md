## The Overview
During my second year at university, I took my first game development course. After forming teams for this project, we used spreadsheets and key prompts like "a game with an interesting mechanic where ____" to brainstorm ideas. Every idea was listed and assessed, with the best ones being expanded until we settled on a concept we liked.

We then pitched our final idea: a game where you play as a chef on a cooking show, memorizing ingredients for a recipe and then selecting them correctly from a given selection. Players then follow cooking instructions to bake their dessert. Our goal was to create an intense and stressful game. Initially, we planned to have one set of recipes, but feedback from our professor and industry guests encouraged us to focus on replayability. This led to the addition of randomization in the ingredients, varying things like the type of sugar (granulated, brown sugar, cane sugar) while maintaining the essence of the original recipes.

This project allowed me to learn essential Unity basics such as creating and using prefabs, animating, reading inputs, and working with basic physics. With the strongest coding experience in the group, I implemented the scoring systems, difficulties, cooking mechanics, interactions, animations, and several vector assets.

Our teamwork was crucial in this project. We collaborated on idea generation, story narrative, some asset creation, and most importantly, troubleshooting and debugging. The team effectively communicated and supported each other, which was vital for overcoming challenges and ensuring a cohesive final product.

During the virtual demo day, we were thrilled to see players experience the stress and fun we intended. The intense classical music, daunting timers, and quick memorization tasks created the desired emotional response. The randomization of ingredients and varying difficulties incentivized players to replay the game and achieve higher scores. Some even attempted speed runs.

While not the pinnacle of my game development works, this project was a significant stepping stone in learning Unity and understanding the dynamics of teamwork in game development.
