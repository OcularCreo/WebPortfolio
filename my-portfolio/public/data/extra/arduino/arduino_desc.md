## The Overview
Ghost Control is an engaging interactive arcade game where players terminate ghosts appearing through five portals using a custom remote control. Inspired by classic arcade games, it combines nostalgic gameplay with modern technology.
Design Highlights

- **User-Centric Design:** Feedback from users of different ages refined the game's layout and remote control for comfort and ease of use.
- **Innovative Hardware:** The familiar TV remote design, with added joystick and flashlight control, ensures intuitive gameplay.
- **Technical Challenge:** Successfully used LEDs as light sensors, overcoming data leakage and sensor sensitivity issues through innovative programming and hardware adjustments.

## Using LEDs as Light Sensors
A significant challenge was using LED lights as photodiode light sensors. We addressed sensor sensitivity and data leakage issues by implementing "fake" reads to clear residual data and soldering a noise filter onto the Arduino models.

## Final Thoughts
Ghost Control showcases my ability to combine technical skills with creative design, adapting to challenges and incorporating user feedback to enhance the final product. This project highlights my proficiency in hardware and software integration and my commitment to creating engaging and user-friendly experiences.
