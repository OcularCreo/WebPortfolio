## The Overview
This project showcases a Python script for Autodesk Maya that calculates and visualizes intersections between a reference object and an intersection object in 3D space. The script features a user interface (UI) for easy interaction and provides detailed feedback on intersection points, plane equations, and angles. This project demonstrates my ability to combine Python scripting with 3D modeling in Maya, creating a dynamic tool for 3D intersection analysis. It showcases skills in programming, problem-solving, and tool development, making it a valuable addition to my portfolio.

## Key Features
- User-Friendly Interface: Allows users to select objects and find intersections with the click of a button.
- Accurate Calculations: Uses geometric algorithms to determine intersection points and verify their accuracy.
- Visual Feedback: Draws cubes at intersection points and displays detailed information in the UI.

## Process
- Setup: Users first select a reference object and then an intersection object.
- Execution: Pressing "Find Intersections" runs the findIntersect() function.
- Calculation: The script collects vertices and center positions, calculates plane equations, and determines intersection points.
- Verification: Uses the triangle area method to verify intersections.
- Visualization: Displays intersection points with cubes and detailed data in the UI.
