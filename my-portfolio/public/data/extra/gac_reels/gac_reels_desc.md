## The Overview
During my time working at Global Affairs Canada in the Division of Education, I was an integral part of the social media team tasked with attracting international students to study in Canada through the use of social media. My role later expanded towards creating compelling video content for the EduCanada social media accounts, focusing on platforms such as Instagram Reels. Among the many videos I created, a cooking video has garnered nearly 7,000 views on the EduCanada account, becoming the most popular reel on the feed.

## The Process

**1. Content Planning:** I began by identifying relevant content themes based on current trends, seasonal events, or partnership requirements. Collaborating with my team, we developed a cohesive theme for each video project.

**2. Moodboard Creation:** I created moodboards that included images and screenshots from stock footage available through our paid account, as well as color schemes aligned with the chosen theme. These moodboards were then presented and pitched to our manager for approval.

**3. Video Production:** Upon receiving the green light, I sourced licensed stock footage and music from company resources. I leveraged Adobe After Effects and Premiere Pro to assemble the video reel, incorporating feedback from my mentor and team.

**4. Mentorship and Collaboration:** I received guidance from the teamâ€™s video producer on effective workflows and advanced editing techniques. I also worked closely with colleagues to finalize scripts and text content.

**5. Finalization and Review:** Within 3-4 days, I produced a polished video version for review. Based on managerial feedback, I made necessary adjustments to ensure the final product met our quality standards.
