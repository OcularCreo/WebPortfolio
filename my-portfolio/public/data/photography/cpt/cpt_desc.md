Drawing from my original photography, I designed Invisibilia as a high school capstone project to highlight my skills in both design and photography. Each section showcases themed collections that reflect my versatility and depth in these areas. Unlike the photobook I later created in university, Invisibilia presents each page individually in PDF format. For the best experience, please view this PDF as a physical book, with each two-page spread after the cover representing a full spread. You can explore the project here on the page or open it in a separate tab by clicking the link above the PDF viewer.

## SOFTWARE & TOOLS

---

- **Canon T6i:** All photographs were taken with this DSLR camera in manual mode, allowing precise control over exposure and settings.
Tamron Telephoto Lens: Frequently used for standard shots, filtered images, and light painting, this lens provides versatility across various styles.

- **Canon 50mm Lens:** Ideal for creating bokeh effects and capturing standard images with a natural perspective.

- **Macro Extension Tube:** Physical attachment that enabled extreme close-up shots, enhancing fine detail and texture in macro photographs.

- **Polarized Filter:** Reduced glare and improved colour saturation, particularly for outdoor photography.

- **Cardboard Paper Cutouts:** Crafted custom cutouts to produce unique bokeh shapes, adding a creative touch to selective images.

- **Adobe Lightroom:** The primary software for post-processing, where I adjusted lighting, contrast, and other elements to enhance each photograph.

- **Adobe Photoshop:** Specialized post-processing tool used for infrared images, enhancing colour and adding unique effects.

- **Adobe InDesign:** Designed the photobook layout in PDF format, carefully arranging each image for optimal presentation.

## FEATURED THEMES AND TECHNIQUES

---

- **Bokeh:** Used a 50mm lens and custom cardboard cutouts to shape light bokeh, creating unique patterns in the background that enhance the artistic feel of the images.

- **Polarized:** Applied a polarized filter to outdoor scenes, reducing glare and enriching colours. Additionally, I positioned plastic in front of a white screen, which, with proper filter alignment, made the screen appear black while the plastic revealed light, producing a striking effect.

- **Macro:** Captured intricate close-ups of subjects like bees, a human eye, and fruit, emphasizing fine details and textures often overlooked in everyday scenes.

- **Light Painting:** Used long exposures to capture car lights along the highway at night, transforming the moving lights into flowing trails and adding a dynamic, artistic quality to the landscape.

- **Low Shutter:** Experimented with low shutter speeds to create multiple exposures, attempting to produce ghost-like copies of myself in a single frame. While the technique was challenging, it offered valuable experience with layered imagery.

- **Infrared:** Extensively utilized Photoshop to simulate infrared effects in outdoor scenes, achieving surreal colour shifts and transforming landscapes into dreamlike, otherworldly settings.

## RESULTS AND REFLECTIONS

---

This project marks the early stages of my design and photography skills. Many photographs presented within the book offer an impressive display of skills through the well-crafted design. Valuable experience was gained while exploring each genre of photography with care and creativity, resulting in many striking images. Looking back on this project now, I recognize the improvements I have made within each area and aim to have the same perspective in my more recent work while continuing to grow my skills.
