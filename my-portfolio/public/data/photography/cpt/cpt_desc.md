## The Overview
Ending off my high school career, I was tasked with creating and designing a photobook showcasing my own original images. This project marked a significant milestone in my early photography journey, featuring sections dedicated to various themes and techniques such as bokeh, infrared, macro, and more.

The photobook highlights my versitility and evolving expertise in photography and design from an early stage. While a small section reveals an area where the consistency of quality wasn't fully established, the majority of the photos and designs demonstrate a high level of skill that overshadows this flaw.

Constrasting with the photobook I created in univeristy, each page has been formatted separately in the PDF. While observing, I encourage you to keep in mind that this pdf is meant to be veiwed as a book, so image every two pages after the cover as a full spread. Feel free to view the project directly here on the page or through a seperate tab by clicking the link above the PDF viewer.
