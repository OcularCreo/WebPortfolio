Exploring public spaces and capturing candid moments, encouraged me to practice identifying decisive moments that define street photography. I wandered the streets of downtown Ottawa during the height of the pandemic to capture the cityâ€™s transformed atmosphere. Each moment was carefully assessed for its impact, emotion, and composition before post-production in Adobe Lightroom converting the best photographs to grayscale. Applying the edits allowed me to emphasize contrast, light, shadow, and texture to enhance the images.

## SOFTWARE & TOOLS

---

- Canon T6i

- Canon 50mm Lens

- Tamron Telephoto Lens 

- Adobe Lightroom

## LENSE UTILIZATION

---

Switching between lenses gave me flexibility in capturing various types of scenes. The 50mm lens lets me capture sharp images and portraits with natural bokeh. In contrast, the telephoto lens allowed me to remain discreet and capture subjects from a distance without disturbing them. Although the 50mm lens is a fixed lens, this limitation pushed me further to be more creative with composition and positioning. Adobe Lightroom allowed me to fine-tune lighting and contrast while applying greyscale to each photograph.

## PROCESS

--- 

Over several days, I explored iconic areas of downtown Ottawa including the once-busy areas of Sparkstreet, the ByWard Market, and Rideau Street. I found it interesting to see the limited number of open businesses and independent bubbles each person maintained while walking down the street. In addition to the new environment, I experimented with unique angles, shallow angles, which offer a unique view of the world that I believe is rarely noticed or utilized.  

## RESULTS AND REFLECTIONS

---

This project sharpened my street photography skills, particularly identifying decisive and meaningful moments. The process of capturing candid scenes in a rapidly changing environment during the pandemic also deepened my appreciation for the subtle ways in which light, composition, and timing can tell a powerful story.
