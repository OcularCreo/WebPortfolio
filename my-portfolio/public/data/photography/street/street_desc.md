## The Overview
Displayed above are candid photographs I captured in downtown Ottawa to sharpen my street photography skills. Over several days of exploring the city, I captured many compelling moments that reflect the city's atmosphere during the pandemic. Inspired by numerous examples of street photography, I edited the photos in black and white to enhance their impact. To fully appreciate each image, I recommend clicking on them to view the full, uncropped versions.
