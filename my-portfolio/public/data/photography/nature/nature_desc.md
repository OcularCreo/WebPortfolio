## The Overview
Heading out into the cold Canadian winter, I ventured into Ottawa's natural environments to capture its beauty through my photography. I found myself facinated by frozen lakes covered in snow, as they would resemble a frozen desert. In these images, the blue sky and the snow almost merge together, creating a vast, cool, and serene scene. Snow drastically changes the view of landscapes, adding new textures to areas already rich in detail.

To fully experience the captured images of nature, I highly recommend clicking on the images to view them uncropped.
