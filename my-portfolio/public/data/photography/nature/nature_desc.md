During the height of Ottawa’s winter, I ventured outside to explore the frozen environment. Visiting parks and trails allowed me to discover beauty within the predominantly white landscape. The outcome of my photographs created a gallery of minimalistic images containing negative space, texture, and contrast. For the true visual experience, make sure to view each image by clicking or scrolling through each uncropped version displayed in the preview carousel.

## RESULTS AND REFLECTIONS

---

Moving between many parks and trails allowed me to capture many unique characteristics of Ottawa’s natural winter environment. Blankets of snow transformed the landscape into a cooler, uniform scene, while frozen water surfaces created vast, barren expanses that evoke a sense of isolation and serenity. Vast negative spaces promote the sense of scale and space, inviting viewers to imagine themselves within these areas and drawing attention to the focal subjects.

Redness from berries created a striking contrast within the neutral colours of a snowy environment. Prominent soft and rough texture exists in the images of the bird and tree trunk, where viewers can almost feel the softness of the bird’s feathers and the rugged, frozen moss and mushrooms on the bark. 

While finding success in winter photography, I intended to continue to improve my skills within this area. My next steps involve deepening my editing techniques in Lightroom and studying professionally captured winter images for inspiration. Overall, the details, conditions, and sensations of the photographs in this collage successfully convey Ottawa’s winter environment.
