⁤To showcase my best work throughout my university photography course, I designed the photobook Captum, Latin for “captured”, for my final assignment. This photo book features the strongest images captured during the course, along with re-shot photos that incorporate past feedback to improve technique, design, and editing. Each spread follows a two-page layout, with wide PDF pages representing two physical pages. Layout designs like bleeding images into neighbouring pages and edges were included to create unique and engaging print designs, demonstrating my ability to combine photography thoughtfully with creative layouts.

## SOFTWARE & TOOLS

---

- **Canon T6i:** All photographs were taken using this DSLR camera in manual mode.

- **Adobe Lightroom Classic:** Used for post-processing and editing, helping to enhance the colour, contrast, and overall aesthetic of each image.

- **Adobe InDesign:** The design and layout of the photobook were completed in InDesign, ensuring a professional and cohesive presentation for both digital and physical formats.

## FEATURED TECHNIQUES & THEMES

---

- **Introduction/About Me:** A personal introduction, offering viewers insight into my journey as a photographer and the themes explored in this collection.

- **High Key Photography:** Overexposed images that help remove distracting backgrounds and wash out visible imperfections in the subject.

- **Nature Photography:** Beautiful winter landscapes and animals found in Ottawa’s parks and wildlife.

- **Night Photography:** Long-exposure shots that experiment with low shutter speeds to capture dynamic scenes in low-light conditions, emphasizing movement and atmosphere.

- **Architecture:** Geometric patterns and forms found in Ottawa’s architecture, blending symmetry and contrast to highlight architectural beauty.

- **Street Photography:** Candid explorations of downtown life in Ottawa during the pandemic.

## RESULTS AND REFLECTIONS

Having started my photography journey in high school, this project marks the culmination of years of growth in composition, technique, and design. Each section demonstrated my commitment and drive to dive into new techniques, whether carefully planning for the right weather for astrophotography or exploring the streets of Ottawa for hours to capture compelling and authentic street photography. Completing Captum reinforced my passion for photography, allowing me to apply technical knowledge while expressing creativity across various themes.
