## ⁤The Overview ⁤

⁤The final assignment of my university photography course challenged students to create and design a photobook showcasing their best work throughout the course. ⁤⁤While doing so, we were advised to re-attempt and improve some photographs them based on previous feedback. ⁤

⁤The photobook I created is designed as a two-page spread, so each wide page in the PDF represents two fully opened pages in the physical book. ⁤⁤For the best viewing experience, I recommend opening the PDF in a separate tab and scrolling left and right to see each spread properly. ⁤⁤A link to do so is provided below the PDF viewer on this page. ⁤

⁤The book features a variety of themes and techniques in photography, including: ⁤

- Introduction/About Me
- High Key Photography
- Nature Photography
- Night Photography (Including Low Shutter)
- Architecture 
- Street Photography

⁤This project allowed me to refine my skills and demonstrate my versatility as a photographer, highlighting my ability to capture diverse subjects and master different photographic techniques. ⁤
