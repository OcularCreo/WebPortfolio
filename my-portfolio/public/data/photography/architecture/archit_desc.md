This section of the portfolio showcases my skills in architectural photography. The images primarily focus on famous monuments and buildings in Canada's capital city, Ottawa. Through careful composition and attention to detail, each image highlights the intricate designs, deeper meanings, and impact within the architecture.

These photographs reflect my ability to find and frame compelling angles that emphasize the beauty and craftsmanship of architectural design. I highly recommend clicking on the images above to experience them in full, non-cropped detail.
