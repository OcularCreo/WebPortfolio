Architecture photography is one of the most iconic photography themes, allowing for the exploration of form, line, atmosphere, and more. In this project, I used a DSLR camera to capture Ottawa’s architectural details, while experimenting with focal length, composition, perspective, lighting, framing, and lines. Each photo showcases the intricate details, deeper meanings, and impact of Ottawa’s monuments and buildings. Click on each picture or switch through the carousel viewer to view the images uncropped.

## TECHNIQUE AND APPROACH

---

Before heading out to capture these photos, I spent time exploring online references in architectural photography. This helped me identify elements that create compelling images and inspired me to experiment with different angles and perspectives. As I made my way through the city, I looked closely for lines, patterns, shapes, and compositions that would highlight each building’s character. In post-processing, I enhanced the colours and fine-tuned details to distinguish the unique architectural features captured in each shot.

## RESULTS AND REFLECTIONS

---

Through this project, I aimed to explore and convey different architectural elements, from symmetry and blocky modern designs to the abstract and expressive qualities of structures. Each photograph highlights unique aspects, such as the intriguing symmetry of a greenhouse, the shifting angles of a monument, and the warm, blocky textures of modern buildings.

As I reflected on the images I captured, I saw even greater potential in the photograph of the apartment building alongside the residential house. Revisiting this location, I would create a greater focus on the house, highlighting the contrast and gradual shift as large city structures encroach upon traditional neighbourhoods. Overall, this experience with architectural photography was highly satisfying, and I look forward to continuing to explore and develop my skills in this field.
