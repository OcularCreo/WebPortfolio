## The Overview
Taking to the night, I explored the many areas and posibilities of nighttime photography. My most notable dedication to this project involved planning for clear skies and driving hours outside the city to areas with minimal light pollution. There, I captured numerous night sky photographs, experimenting with unique ways to photograph the stars.

I did not limit myself to just photographying stars, as I delved into other themes of long-exposure photography such as steel wool photography, highway long exposure, and low shutter car tracking, and many others. To truly appreciate the captured images, I highly recommend clicking on them to view their fully uncropped versions.
