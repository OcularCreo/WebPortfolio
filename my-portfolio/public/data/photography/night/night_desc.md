Long-exposure photography explores the unique possibilities of photography, capturing motion and light in ways beyond natural human perception. Using different exposure times, I explored motion, light painting, steel wool, and star photography. Through research, collecting materials, and careful timing, I created a stunning gallery of images that utilize the advantages of long exposure times.

## SOFTWARE & TOOLS

- Canon T6i

- Tripod

- Tamron Multi-Use Telephoto Lens

- Canon 50mm Lens

- Adobe Lightroom Lightroom

- Whisk, String, Steel Wool, Lighter (Steel Wool Photography)

## TECHNIQUE AND APPROACH

---

While on Bank Street, I captured the trail of headlights and brake lights to convey motion. Altering the perspective, I captured passing streetlights within a car, enhancing the sensation of motion. On pedestrian bridges, I framed the flow of highway traffic from above, using long exposure to create streaking lights with varying directions and intensity.

Inspired by star photography, I ventured outside Ottawa to a low-light area, timing the shoot with a clear, moonless night to reduce light pollution. Long exposures revealed numerous stars and allowed me to capture the stars’ motion, creating circular streaks that reveal Earth’s rotation.

For steel wool photography, I collaborated with a partner in a snowy field. Using a whisk filled with ignited steel wool, I spun the setup in circles to capture dramatic light patterns safely.

## RESULTS AND REFLECTIONS

This project was an eye opening experience in planning and execution for long-exposure photography. Each required setup gave me valuable experience and practice within this area of photography. The requirements to capture each type of image and hope to expand upon the knowledge I gained. I plan to continue expanding my skills in long-exposure photography as my interest in this area grows.
