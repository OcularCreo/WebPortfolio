## The Overview
Playing around with my at home studio setup, I practiced the techniques of high key and low key photography. High key photography involves using bright lighting to overexpose the subject, creating a clean, white background that minimizes shadows and highlights the subject's features, often giving a soft and flawless appearance. Low key photography, on the other hand, uses darker tones and controlled lighting to create strong contrasts, emphasizing shadows and creating a dramatic, moody effect.

While researching these techniques, I noticed many examples of both high and low key photography edited into black and white. Seeing this naturally lead me to experimented with both fully colored and black and white versions.
