To practice and strengthen my understanding of the camera’s light meter, I pursued the genres of high-key and low-key photography. High-key photography uses bright tones and lighting, often used in portraits to lighten or blow out shadows and imperfections. Low-key photography uses darker tones and reduced lighting to create striking contrast and strong shadows. Each displayed image was taken at varying exposures, allowing me to refine my understanding of the necessary situations and potential outcomes of different exposures.

## SOFTWARE & TOOLS

---

- Canon T6i

- Canon 50mm Lens

- Adobe Lightroom Lightroom

- Umbrella Studio Lights

- Studio Backdrop

## TECHNIQUE AND APPROACH

---

Having the advantage of owning a backdrop and umbrella lights, I created a setup aligning with the given genre. The setup for high-key utilized a key and fill light positioned to limit and reduce shadow on the subject. Alternatively, the low-key lighting setup only utilized a key light positioned further from the subject to introduce strong contrast and reduced lighting.

While reviewing several references of high and low-key photography, I noticed that portrait subjects wore very dark or light clothing in the images. With this observation, I requested my portrait subject to have two sets of clothing for each genre. While switching between exposures, I directed my subject to different fashion-type poses but ultimately allowed her to create and choose them naturally.

## RESULTS AND REFLECTIONS

---

The final result of the high-key and low-key photographs reflect inspiration from fashion portrait photography. The subject’s unique posing in the portrait images offers an essence found in other portrait photography found in magazines and within fashion. Some final images are in black and white to align with their theme and follow along with several references.

Experimenting with different exposures while practicing high-key and low-key photography proved to be a success, leading to the development of fashionable and engaging portraits. Overall, this project strengthened my skills and understanding of my camera’s light meter, allowing me to refine my existing expertise in photography.
