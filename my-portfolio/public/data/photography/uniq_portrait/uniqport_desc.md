This collection of images is a combination of portrait photographs from two different projects. The goal of the first was to create impactful portraits that told a striking narrative. Alternatively, the second project aimed to create portraits with studio lighting techniques. Through creative processes and planning, I composed photographs that leaned heavily into artistic interpretation and commentary. Being fortunate enough to have a small studio lighting set at home, I also created images focusing on studio lighting techniques, the best of which turned out to be the looping and split portraits.

## PORTRAIT INTENTIONS

---

The photograph featuring myself significantly shaped by tape represents the artificial elements and emotions many photographs can contain. Often subjects in photographs smile for the photo rather than the moment, which can lead to forced and faked representations of that particular moment. The tape symbolizes how our social expectations in photography can forcefully make subjects express themselves in ways they do not genuinely feel. 

The image of the elderly woman is of my grandmother. The intention of the project included careful planning, the plan for this photograph was to capture an abrupt portrait. This allowed me to capture my grandmother in a genuine form and led to an image highly regarded in the course. 

The extreme close-up portrait represents the feeling of roughness. The combination of the aggressive facial features and rough texture given by the chalk drive the intended emotional and physical sensation of roughness. Regardless of the person, humans all have a rough side as our roots are drawn by primal nature. 

The remaining images are my favourite of the studio lighting portrait project. These two demonstrate loop and split lighting on the subject. I also created images following lighting techniques like Rembrandt, Butterfly, Board, and short lighting, however with limited portrait subjects at the time I had to put myself in front of the camera causing many challenges.

## RESULTS AND REFLECTIONS

The collection of portraits demonstrates my abilities within the technical and artistic components of portrait photography. The artistically focused portraits successfully explored themes of authenticity, social expression, and raw emotion. As a photographer, I will continue to capture interesting portraits that convey thoughtful messages and follow improved techniques. Overall each portrait was well received and successfully achieved my desired goals.
