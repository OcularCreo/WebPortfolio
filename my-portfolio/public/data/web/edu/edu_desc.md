## The Overview
This project showcases one of my earliest ventures into web development. Designed as an educational platform focused on teaching users about the Middle Ages, it demonstrates the beginnings of my foundational knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I incorporated original designs, interactive features, and engaging animations to create an immersive learning experience.

## Key Features
- Interactive Lessons: Users can navigate through various lessons, each with interactive content and animations to maintain engagement.
- Glossary Links: Anchor tags on potentially unfamiliar terms link to a glossary, providing easy access to definitions.
- Quizzes: After completing a lesson, users can take a 15-minute timed quiz to test their knowledge of the material.
- Final Exam: Upon finishing all the lessons, users can take a comprehensive 45-minute exam to assess their overall learning.

## Reflections
Creating this website was a fun and educational experience, allowing me to explore the basics of web development. Looking back, I recognize areas where I could improve, such as toning down the animations and refining some design elements. This project marked the beginning of my journey in web development and sparked my own interests into web development as a whole.
