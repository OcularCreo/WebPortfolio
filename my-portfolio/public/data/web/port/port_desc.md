## SOFTWARE, TOOLS, & LANGUAGES

---

- **Languages & Libraries:** React, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JSON, Markdown

- **Frameworks:** React Router, Font Awesome, React Markdown, ~~Bootstrap~~

- **Development Tools:** Visual Studio Code, Github, Git Bash

- **Design Tools:** Figma, Illustrator, Photoshop, Premiere Pro

## KEY FEATURES

---

- Designed & Developed a fully responsive React application with modular components.

- Integrated Navigation System using React Router for seamless transitions between pages.

- Optimized Load Times using lazy loading and .webp image formats to enhance performance.

- Created Custom Layouts with CSS Grid and Flexbox for consistent styling and spacing.

## DEVELOPMENT PROCESS

---

The project began with extensive research and brainstorming on platforms like Pinterest and Adobe Portfolio to define the desired look and feel. Initial designs were created in Figma, where I settled on the layout, typography, and color palette for desktop, tablet, and mobile views.

### **Implementation workflow**

1. Component Breakdown: Created individual React components for each section, such as headers, project cards, and footers.

2. Responsive Design: Used CSS Grid and Flexbox to ensure consistent spacing and visual integrity across devices.

3. Navigation Setup: Implemented React Router to handle multi-page navigation and dynamic project routes.

Following this structured approach, I ensured that each feature was thoroughly tested and visually aligned with the overall design.

## TECHNICAL IMPLIMENTATIONS

---

- **JSON-Based Project Management:** Created a modular system using JSON to handle project data, making it easy to update and expand.

- **State Management & Dynamic Routing:** Leveraged React state hooks to dynamically update components based on user interactions and set up nested routing for project detail pages.

- **Lazy Loading & Image Optimization:** Implemented lazy loading for images and converted large assets to .webp to reduce page load times by up to 30%.


## POST LAUNCH REFINEMENTS
