## The Overview
The goal of this project was to create a central hub to display my projects, skills, and experience. Using tools such as React, Figma, and Git, I developed my website portfolio from scratch. I aimed to include key features such as professional look, responsive design, and modularized code, ensuring my work is presented gracefully, accessible on any device, and easy to modify. This project significantly deepened my understanding of React, CSS, and web development as a whole, enhancing my skills in creating responsive, modular web applications and boosting my proficiency in React development.

## The Process
The creation of my website portfolio began with extensive research, sifting through various layout and web design examples on platforms like Pinterest, Adobe Portfolio, and Google Images. The most appealing designs were compiled and utilized in a brainstorming section on a personal Figma project. From the beginning I aimed to incorporate modularization and responsiveness into my website portfolio, applying designs and future plans that would help achieve these goals.

I developed multiple layouts in Figma, focusing on finalizing the design, fonts, and colour palette for mobile, tablet, and desktop views. Standardized dimensions and ratios were used for each screen type to ensure compatibility across different screen sizes. With the website layout finalized, I began developing the React application.

My react workflow naturally followed these steps: 
- Concentrate on one page
- Create needed compononets
- Impliment responsive design

To avoid issues down the line, I immediately tested for bugs after implementing each feature, resolving them quickly. The home page took the longest to implement as it was the most unique and component heavy. Although I had experience with React, this project allowed me to take a deep dive into React and CSS, leading to slower but more significant progress initially. My commitment led me to forums, YouTube videos, and tutorials for tips and tricks to expand my knowledge on CSS and React.

Opting for modularity allowed easy updates and management of projects, images, and descriptions through JSON objects. I designed the components to seamlessly integrate with a future backend, should I choose to implement one. Overall, I created a base system with React and CSS, making the process of adding projects quick and simple, ensuring a smooth implementation of projects.
