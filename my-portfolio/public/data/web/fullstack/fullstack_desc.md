## Software & Languages
 - Pycharm 
 - WebStorm 
 - Django (Python)
 - React
 - Custom database integration with downloaded recipe data

## The Overview
For my first full-stack project, I created a vibrant and user-friendly recipe website that provides cooking enthusiasts a place to find, favorite, and save low-carb recipes in virtual cookbooks. This project marked a milestone in my web development career as it marked my first ever full stack project. Regardless of the time constraints I faced due to the demans of other courses, through the many challanges faced, I learned a lot about full stack development and gained more confidence in web development as a whole. The final results of the project successfully created a functional recipe web application, demonstrating strong front-end design skills, effective database integration, and practical solutions to real-world challenges.

## Design and Implementation
- **Color Palette:** A cheerful and dynamic palette was selected to reflect the joy and creativity of cooking
- **Fonts:** Utilized Nunito Sans, Roboto, and Montserrat from Google Fonts for a clean and modern look
- **Icons:** Sourced from Bootstrap Icons, Awesome Fonts, and icons8, ensuring a cohesive visual theme

## Features
- **Recipe Library:** Integrated a database with thousands of recipes. Due to time constraints, placeholder images were used, and recipes did not include ingredient quantities
- **Search and Pagination:** Implemented search functionality and pagination to handle the display of numerous recipes
- **Cookbook Management:** Enabled users to save recipes to a general account without a detailed login system. Users can create and manage cookbooks, although some advanced features like ingredient scaling and recommendation algorithms were not implemented

## Challenges and Solutions
- **Time Constraints:** Led to the exclusion of a detailed login system and an ingredient scaling feature
- **Placeholder Images:** Used for recipes due to the volume of data
- **Pagination:** Introduced to manage large data sets efficiently
