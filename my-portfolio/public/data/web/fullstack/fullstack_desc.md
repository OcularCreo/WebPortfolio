This full-stack project empowers cooking enthusiasts to discover, save, and organize low-carb recipes in virtual cookbooks. As my first complete web application, this project marked a pivotal step in my full-stack journey, requiring the integration of both front-end and back-end systems under tight deadlines. Through overcoming challenges in data management and front-end design, I developed practical skills in implementing a database and designing an accessible user interface. The final application balances usability and performance, delivering a vibrant experience for users.

## DEVELOPMENT PROCESS

---

Development began with a comprehensive backend proposal submitted for review by the professor and TA. This proposal clearly outlined the project’s purpose and objectives, covering areas such as: target user demographics, potential APIs, web application references, core features, user journeys, and a high-level data structure. Once approved, I incorporated advisor feedback and began backend development using Django. To streamline testing, I built a simple front-end interface, which allowed efficient validation of backend functionality. After confirming structure and function with test entries, I integrated a dataset of over 40,000 recipes and performed further tests to ensure stability and performance at scale.

With backend functionalities solidified, I developed a front-end design document that included hand-drawn wireframes and outlined key design elements, such as color palettes, icon libraries, and fonts. The most critical section mapped front-end to backend interactions, detailing each interaction with its API endpoint, method, backend action, response, and front-end handling. Following approval, I implemented these features in React. Given time constraints across my course load, I streamlined some features and used placeholder images for recipes, as the dataset did not include images.

## KEY FEATURES

---

- **Extensive Recipe Database:** Provides access to over 40,000 low-carb recipes, allowing users to explore a wide range of options tailored to specific dietary needs.

- **Dynamic Interaction Components:** Developed 4 interactive components including “Favourite” and “Create Book” buttons enabling users to save, organize, and personalize their recipe collections. These components interact seamlessly with the backend, allowing real-time updates and enhancing user engagement.

- **Responsive Design:** Built with Bootstrap to ensure a responsive interface, making the application accessible and visually appealing across various screen sizes and devices.

- **Optimized Performance:** Integrated search and pagination to efficiently handle large datasets, allowing users to navigate extensive recipe collections with ease. This functionality optimizes load times and ensures smooth browsing, even with high data volume.

## REFLECTIONS AND RESULTS

---

Completing this project boosted my confidence in full-stack development and deepened my understanding of developing web applications. Despite tight deadlines, demanding course load, and dataset limitations, I adapted the project to quickly address issues. For instance, since the dataset lacked recipe images, I implemented placeholder images to maintain consistent styling and visual appeal. Managing a large dataset presented several challenges, which I overcame by introducing pagination to enhance performance and user experience. The final product is a functional, engaging recipe web application that demonstrates strong front-end design, seamless database integration, and practical problem-solving applied to real-world challenges. This project reinforced my ability to build scalable applications prioritizing usability and performance. By taking on similar projects in the future, I aim to continue to grow my full-stack skills.
