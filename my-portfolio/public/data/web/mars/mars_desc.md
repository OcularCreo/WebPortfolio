## The Overview

For our term project, the Struggle Bus group collaborated to develop an educational VR experience using A-Frame and CirclesXR. The project focused on the four Mars rovers: Sojourner, Perseverance, Curiosity, Spirit, and Opportunity. We divided tasks such as programming, modeling, and research among ourselves, continuously learning and adapting as the project evolved.

## About A-Frame and CirclesXR

A-Frame is a web framework for building virtual reality experiences. It allows developers to create 3D scenes and VR environments using HTML-like syntax, making it accessible for web developers familiar with front-end technologies.

CirclesXR is a library that extends A-Frame with additional features and components for building more complex VR interactions and networking capabilities. It simplifies the creation of multiplayer VR experiences by handling many of the underlying technical challenges.

## Project Development

Initially, our scope included all four Mars rovers, but we later adjusted to focus on Sojourner, Perseverance, and Curiosity, adding interactive elements like opening drawers and 3D printing. The modeling tasks required significant time, which impacted the programming progress, necessitating the use of placeholders.

In the final stages, we modularized our work, allowing us to quickly assemble the final product using multiple iterations of modularized components.

## Challenges

- CirclesXR Setup: Setting up CirclesXR and the corresponding GitHub repository was challenging due to our varying levels of experience with these tools.
- Custom Pick-up System: We had to create our own pick-up system to achieve specific object interaction behaviors, which posed additional challenges, especially with networking.
- Modeling Delays: Delays in model creation limited programming progress, requiring frequent adjustments to placeholders for size, number, and naming conventions.
- Overcomplication: Some team members overcomplicated their tasks, which consumed additional time and required better oversight and simplification.

## Successes

- Modularization: We successfully created modular pieces for both models and code, allowing dynamic assembly of various components, akin to creating a set of prefabs for game development.
- Interactive Features: The interactions between players and the rover parts worked well. A notable feature was allowing players to click on placed parts to hear comments from the rover, enhancing the educational aspect.

## Time Investment

Each team member independently spent an average of 10 hours per week on the project.
Conclusion

This project demonstrated our ability to develop an engaging and educational VR experience using A-Frame and CirclesXR. It highlighted our skills in modular development, problem-solving, and teamwork, making it a valuable addition to our portfolio for web development, VR, and interactive experiences.
